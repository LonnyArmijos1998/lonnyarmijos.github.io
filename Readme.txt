5. Ride duration details in HH:MM:SS format and day of the week

SELECT
  *,
  TIMESTAMP_DIFF(ended_at, started_at, SECOND) AS ride_length_seconds,
  CONCAT(
    LPAD(CAST(FLOOR(TIMESTAMP_DIFF(ended_at, started_at, SECOND) / 3600) AS STRING), 2, '0'), ':',

  ) AS ride_length_formatted,
  EXTRACT(DAYOFWEEK FROM started_at) AS day_of_week
